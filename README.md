# Introduction

1. I'm to do a deep dive into ***Node*** itself without cluttering with other tools and ***NPM packages*** and truly master this technology.

2. I'll use vital concepts to build various exciting projects *just* using Node.

3. This not only includes some Node.js essentials but also computer science and back-end engineering concepts.

## Understood [Event Emitters](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/events.html#class-eventemitter) ‚úÖ

Learnt how Node's event driven architechture is enabled by EventEmitter, what is it and it's internals by creating a naive emitter implementation of my own.

## Understood [Buffers](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer) ‚úÖ

Deeply understood buffers and how to work directly with binary data.

Different ways of creating Buffers, how *safe* and *unsafe* allocations differ in their initialization, *fastest way* to allocate memory using Node's internal *memory pool*, proper way to *store* and *read* negative ints and much more.

## Understanding [File System](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#file-system) üßë‚Äçüíª

As a back-end developer, I'll work with files a lot, be it saving some data to disk, handling file uploads and many other examples, so it's essential to have a good understanding of them and learning how Node.js deals with files resulting in mastery of the *"fs"* module.

What exactly is a *file* and *filedata* associated with it, how does Node behind the scenes *requests* a file from an OS via *system calls* like *open()* and *rename()* and what are they, Different APIs Node exposes for file operations .... Work In Progress ‚ö†Ô∏è
